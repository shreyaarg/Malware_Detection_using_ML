# Malware_Detection_using_ML
The model will be able to detect the malware, depending upon how the model is trained under different machine learning algorithms using the same dataset. The accuracy of the model will be different under all the algorithms. The model is trained and tested under four different algorithms such as logisitic regression, random forest classifier, support vector classifier and neural network. It is shown that according to the dataset used, the model performs best under logistic regression as it has the highest accuracy.
